Project One README

The game is a "skill-shot/target practice" style game that is similar in functionality to NES Duckhunt. 

2 players take turns "shooting" targets using a combination of keyup&click events simulate shooting/aiming.

Players hit as many targets as possible during a set interval or "round".

Targets will generate randomly && move around the game field && vanish if not hit by player within a certain interval

Scores are kept and after both players get turn the winner is posted via an alert popup
